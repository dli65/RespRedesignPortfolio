            <h3>A Responsive Redesign</h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "textsect">
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>This project is focused on designing and building a new responsive webpage for an existing website. Though this project, I worked on identifying and analyzing flaws in the existing webpage in terms of usability, learnability, memorability, and accessibility. With the problems identified, I then created low and high fidelity prototypes and a visual guide, and built a responsive webpage.</p>
          <p
          style = 
          "color: #ED5819;">
          The website I chose to redesign was the <a style = 
          "color: #ED5819;" href="https://www.cakesofparadisebakery.com/">Cakes of Paradise Bakery website</a>, a Hawaiian bakery in the Seattle Area.</p>
          <h5 class = "greytitle">The Original Site</h5>

        </div>
        <div class="textsect">
          <h4>Identifying Issues</h4>
          <p>In looking at the current Cakes of Paradise Bakery website, I focused on the homepage in particular. To identify the current issues with the website, I looked at three areas:<br>
            - usability<br>
            - learnability<br>
            - memorabiilty
            </p>

            <div class = "row">
              <div class = "responsebox">
                <h6 class = "color" 
                  >Usability</h6>
                <p >- Needs to scroll down to see store hours <br>
                  - Chunk of text at the top covers different information, but has no clear hierarchyâ€¨- Not responsive; text size does not change with screen size<br>
                  - No directions on Home Page<br>
                  - No informtional hierarchy between normal hours and holiday hours</p>
              </div>
              <div class = "responsebox">
                <h6 class = "color" 
                 style = 
                 >Learnability</h6>
                <p>- Fairly learnable due to simplicity; homepage displays information and links to other pages<br>
                  - Information displayed on screen is not in a very intuitive order: Note, then picture, then hours</p>
              </div>
              <div class = "responsebox">
                <h6 class = "color" 
                 style = 
                 >Memorabiilty</h6>
                <p>- No cohesive theme to the website: lacks memorable design<br>
                  - Difficult to identify titles: chunks of text lack informational hierarchy<br>
                  - Could benefit from a color palette and more images</p>
              </div>
            </div><br>
            <h6 class = "color" 
                 style = 
                 >Accessibility</h6>
            <p>I also gauged the accessibility of a website using WebAIM Wave and a Screen Reader, coming up with the following issues:<br>
              - The images on the page lack alt text, making them inaccessible for a Screen Reader<br>
              - There is a lot of text at the top of the page, so it takes a long time to reach the hours at the bottom.<br>
              - The color contrast of the logo is not very strong,  making it difficult to read.<br><br>
         
         With these issues identified, I could start on designing the new webpage to address them.</p>
            </div>
          

          <div class="textsect">
            <h4>Low Fidelity Wire Frames</h4>
            <p>To address the previously identified problems, I create wireframes for a responsive new homepage using Balsamiq:<br>
            </p>
            <img src="CakesofParadiseBakeryImg/AnnotatedLowWF.png" alt="Low-Fidelity WireFrames">
          </div>
          <br>

          <div class="textsect">
            <h4>Visual Guide</h4>
            <p>Before making the final design, I created a visual guide for the website, focusing on color palette, typography, interactive components, and icons.</p>
            <img src="CakesofParadiseBakeryImg/VisualGuide.png" alt="Visual Guide" style="width:90%;">
            <p>I chose the color palette to match the floral, tropical theme that the physical store had. I also created a new logo, and chose typefaces to give the page a more elegant and simplistic appearance.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="textsect">
            <h4>High Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
            <p>After developing the low fidelity prototypes and the visual guide, I was able to create the final design of the website.</p>
            <h5 class = "greytitle">Annotated Final Design</h5> <br>
            <img src="CakesofParadiseBakeryImg/AnnotatedFinal.png" alt="High Fidelity Designs" >
            <h5 class = "greytitle">Unannotated Final Design</h5> <br>

          <div class="textsect">
            <h4>Responsive Webpage</h4>
            <p>Based upon the annotations from the high fidelity design, I created a responsive website in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
            <br>Click <a style = 
            "color: #ED5819;" href="https://agile-coast-61943.herokuapp.com/">here</a> to access the site! <br>Website Link: https://agile-coast-61943.herokuapp.com/</p>

          <div class="textsect">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Throughout this project, my biggest takeaway was how usability in design has such a big impact, even for a simple information-displaying webpage. Looking at the order and visual design of the text and components plays such a large role in usability, especially in how we process and compartmentalize the information based on how it is separated. I also gained insight into how to ensure a webpage is accessibile, and the tools that play a role in doing so.
              <br>
              The development of the website was a little trickier, but gave me insight into different displays for containers and how they function.</p>
